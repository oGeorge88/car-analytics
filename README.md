# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
Features:
Interactive Dashboard: Explore a dynamic dashboard with search, sort, and highlight functionalities. Highlighted cars are saved to Local Storage for easy access, and a convenient scroll-to-top feature enhances navigation.

Highlighted Cars Gallery: View your curated collection of highlighted cars on a dedicated page. Easily manage your selections with the option to remove cars directly from this gallery.
Comprehensive Statistics: Dive into detailed statistics with tables showcasing the number of cars and their values by brand and model. Visual insights are provided through interactive pie3 charts and stacked bar graphs.
